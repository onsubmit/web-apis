The Broadcast Channel API allows basic communication between browsing contexts and workers on the same origin.

By creating a `BroadcastChannel` object, you can receive any messages that are posted to it. You don't have to maintain a reference to the frames or workers you wish to communicate with: they can "subscribe" to a particular channel by constructing their own `BroadcastChannel` with the same name, and have bi-directional communication between all of them.
